# Progress Report - Keylight Implementation

## Overview
Philips Hue notification tool implementation using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## Current Status: Foundation Phase Complete

### Phase 1: TDD Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

#### TDD Cycle 1: CLI Argument Parsing ✅
- **Red Phase**: Created failing tests for CLI argument parsing
  - File: `internal/cli/commands_test.go`
  - Tests: `--success`, `--failure`, `--init-scenes` argument parsing
  - Status: Tests failed as expected (undefined: ParseArgs)

- **Green Phase**: Implemented minimal CLI parsing
  - File: `internal/cli/commands.go`
  - Implementation: Basic `ParseArgs` function with `Command` struct
  - Status: All tests pass

- **Refactor Phase**: Code review and cleanup
  - Status: No refactoring needed, code is clean and minimal

#### TDD Cycle 2: Configuration Management ✅
- **Red Phase**: Created failing tests for JSON config loading
  - File: `internal/hue/config_test.go`
  - Tests: Config file loading, JSON parsing, error handling
  - Status: Tests failed as expected (undefined: LoadConfig)

- **Green Phase**: Implemented JSON configuration loading
  - File: `internal/hue/config.go`
  - Implementation: `Config` struct and `LoadConfig` function
  - Status: All tests pass

- **Refactor Phase**: Code review and cleanup
  - Status: No refactoring needed, code is clean and minimal

### Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with strict TDD discipline rules
- Updated `docs/design/DEVELOPMENT.md` with TDD methodology
- Removed personal name references, standardized to "strict TDD"

### Git History ✅
- Commit 1: `feat(cli,config): implement TDD foundation with CLI parsing and JSON config`
- Commit 2: `docs(development): enforce strict TDD methodology with clear discipline rules`

## Next Phase: Core Functionality

### Phase 2: Hue Bridge Client (PENDING)
- **Planned TDD Cycle 3**: HTTP client for Hue Bridge API
  - Tests for bridge discovery, authentication, API requests
  - Mock HTTP responses for testing
  - Error handling for network failures

- **Planned TDD Cycle 4**: Scene management
  - Scene creation, activation, and querying
  - State capture and restoration logic
  - Default scene definitions

### Phase 3: Integration (PLANNED)
- Main entry point (`main.go`)
- End-to-end integration tests
- Cross-platform build verification

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (PLANNED)
- Multi-format configuration (YAML, TOML)
- Configuration migration tool
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Test Coverage Status
- CLI argument parsing: ✅ 100% coverage
- Configuration loading: ✅ 100% coverage
- Hue Bridge client: ⏳ Not implemented
- Scene management: ⏳ Not implemented
- Integration tests: ⏳ Not implemented

## Development Discipline
- ✅ Following strict TDD methodology
- ✅ Red-Green-Refactor cycles enforced
- ✅ All tests pass before implementation
- ✅ Minimal code to pass tests
- ✅ Conventional commit messages
- ✅ Double-hyphen CLI convention

## Key Technical Decisions Made
1. **Go standard library only** - No external dependencies
2. **Internal package structure** - Proper encapsulation
3. **JSON-first configuration** - Extensible to other formats
4. **Strict TDD discipline** - Documented and enforced
5. **Cross-platform support** - Linux dev, Windows target

## Next Steps
1. Begin TDD Cycle 3: Hue Bridge HTTP client implementation
2. Create failing tests for bridge discovery and authentication
3. Implement minimal HTTP client functionality
4. Continue with scene management in subsequent cycles

## Estimated Progress
- **Foundation Phase**: 100% complete
- **Core Functionality Phase**: 0% complete
- **Integration Phase**: 0% complete
- **Advanced Features Phase**: 0% complete

**Overall Project Progress**: ~25% complete
